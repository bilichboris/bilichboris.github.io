      Arveson's hyperrigidity conjecture predicts that if the non-commutative Choquet boundary of a separable operator system S is the entire spectrum of its generated C*-algebra B then S is hyperrigid in B. We provide a counterexample to the conjecture with a C*-algebra B of type I generated by a single operator.}

      abstract={
      In this paper, we fully characterize maximal representations of a C*-correspondence. This strengthens several earlier results. We demonstrate the criterion with diverse examples. We also describe the noncommutative Choquet boundary and provide additional counterexamples to Arveson's hyperrigidity conjecture following the counterexample recently found by the author and Adam Dor-On.
