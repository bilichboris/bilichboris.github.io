              equivalence relations following work of the second-named author
              with Carlsen and Eilers, both in terms of adjacency matrices and in
              terms of their C*-correspondences, and orient them when possible.
              In particular, we show that if two regular C*-correspondences are
              strong shift equivalent, then the intermediary C*-correspondences
              realizing the equivalence may be chosen to be regular. This result
              provides the final missing piece in answering a question of Muhly,
              Pask and Tomforde, and is used to confirm a conjecture of
              Kakariadis and Katsoulis on shift equivalence of
