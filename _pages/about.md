Since October 2023, I am a PhD student cosupervised by <a href='https://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/rameyer/website/'>Ralf Meyer</a> at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen and <a href='https://adoronmath.wordpress.com/'>Adam Dor-On</a> at University of Haifa.
Before starting my PhD, I was a Master student in Georg-August-Universität Göttingen and a Bachelor student in HSE University, Moscow.

I work in the field of operator algebras and noncommutative geometry. My primary research focus right now is interpretation of constructions such as (higher-rank, topological) graph C*-algebras, Leavitt path algebras, and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras as limits of diagrams in suitable bicategories. The limit universal property then can provide a lot of information about these objects.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
